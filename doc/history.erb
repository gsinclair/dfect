      This release adds new variations to assertion methods, fixes several bugs, and improves test coverage.

      %|paragraph "Thank you"
        * François Beausoleil contributed patches for both code *and* tests! :-)

      %|paragraph "New features"
        * Added <%= xref "Negation", "negation (m!)" %> and <%= xref "Sampling", "sampling (m?)" %> variations to <%= xref "Assertions", "assertion methods" %>.

          These new methods implement assertion functionality missing so far (previously we could not assert that a given exception was NOT thrown) and thereby allow us to fully test Dfect using itself.

        * Added documentation on <%= xref "Insulation", "how to insulate tests" %> from the global Ruby namespace.

      %|paragraph "Bug fixes"
        * The `E()` method did not consider the case where a block does not raise anything as a failure.  ---*François Beausoleil*

        * When creating a report about an assertion failure, an exception would be thrown if any local variables pointed to an empty array.

        * The `Dfect::<()` method broke the inheritance-checking behavior of the < class method.

          Added a bypass to the originial behavior so that `RCov::XX` can properly generate a report about code that uses Dfect.

        * Added workaround for YAML error when serializing a class object:

              TypeError: can't dump anonymous class Class

      %|paragraph "Housekeeping"
        * Filled the big holes in test coverage.  Everything except the runtime debugging logic is now covered by the unit tests.

    %|section "Version 0.0.0 (2009-04-13)"
      This is the first public release of <%= $project %>.  It was inspired by [Sean O'Halpin's musing](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/183354#801895) on alternative names for assertion methods.

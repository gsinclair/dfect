%|chapter "Introduction"
  %|project
    <%= $project %> is an assertion testing library for Ruby that emphasizes a simple assertion vocabulary, instant debuggability of failures, and flexibility in composing tests.

    <%= $project %> is exciting because:
    * It has only 5 methods to remember: D F E C T.
    * It lets you debug assertion failures interactively.
    * It keeps a detailed report of assertion failures.
    * It lets you nest tests and execution hooks.
    * It is implemented in a mere <%= `sloccount lib`[/^\d+/] %> lines of code.

  These features distinguish <%= $project %> from the competition:
  * [assert{ 2.0 }](http://assert2.rubyforge.org)
  * [Verify](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/183354)
  * [Testy](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/182798)
  * [minitest](http://blog.zenspider.com/minitest)
  * [Context](http://github.com/jeremymcanally/context)
  * [Shoulda](http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda)
  * [Bacon](http://chneukirchen.org/repos/bacon/README)
  * [test-spec](http://test-spec.rubyforge.org/test-spec)
  * [RSpec](http://rspec.info)
  * [Test::Unit](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/index.html)

  %|paragraph "Etymology"
    <%= $project %> is named after the D F E C T methods it provides.

    The name is also play on the word "defect", whereby the intentional misspelling of "defect" as "dfect" is a defect in itself!  <tt>;-)</tt>

    This wordplay is similar to [Mnesia](http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/index.html)'s play on the word "amnesia", whereby the intentional omission of the letter "A" indicates forgetfulness---the key characteristic of having amnesia.  Clever!

  %|section "Logistics"
    * <%= xref "History", "Release notes" %> --- history of project releases.
    * [Source code](<%= src_url %>) --- obtain via [Git](<%= git_url %>) or browse online.
    * [API reference](<%= api_url %>) --- documentation for source code.

    %|paragraph "Version numbers"
      <%= $project %> releases are numbered in *major.minor.patch*
      form according to the [RubyGems rational versioning
      policy](http://www.rubygems.org/read/chapter/7), which
      can be summarized thus:

      <table markdown="1">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">What increased in the version number?</td>
            <td colspan="3">The increase indicates that the release:</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Is backward compatible?</th>
            <th>Has new features?</th>
            <th>Has bug fixes?</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>major</th>
            <td style="background-color: #FFE4E1;">No</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>minor</th>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>patch</th>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td style="background-color: #FFE4E1;">No</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>

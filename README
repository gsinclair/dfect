Fork by Gavin Sinclair of Suraj N. Kurapati's 'dfect' testing library.

Things I like about dfect: simplicity, minimalism, good design.

Things I want to implement:
 * Minimal output
 * Colourful output
 * (A few) more assertions, like Eq for asserting equality
 * Facility for user-added assertions
 * Easily select the tests you want to run

It's experimental and tailored specifically to my taste.  I'm not interested in
general output that can be plugged into a CI server or whatever.
